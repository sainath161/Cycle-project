					<h1>Future of Electric Cycles<hr></h1>

					<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">In the next five years, electric bicycles are expected to become more and more similar to non-electric bicycles. Not only will they become hard to recognize as electric bicycles but they’ll also get lighter until the geometry and handling are is almost identical to non-electric bicycles. Some users also think that electric bicycles, especially electric mountain bicycles will start dropping the non-essentials, things like computers, kickstands and battery warnings will fade away until an electric bicycle is a much more stripped-down version of what we find today. Other riders think that electric bicycles will become smarter – tuning in to things like heart rate monitors and suspension inputs to deliver a smoother ride.<br></p><p style = "text-indent:2cm;">These riders think that more technology will mean better and more capable bicycles that go beyond getting you from A to B. Lots of electric bicycle riders are looking at batteries and finding that small improvements could make a big difference. Right now batteries are too small, they take a long time to charge, and crucially you can’t fly with them, making it impossible to travel with an electric bicycle. Cyclists have suggested creating a network of charging stations powered by renewable energy, much like electric cars, electric bicycles could be charged while having a coffee. When it comes to motors, experts are expecting smaller, lighter, quieter and more integrated systems. There are also suggestions of further development of Bluetooth capabilities and integrated mapping systems.<br></p><p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Electric bicycles are set to propel forward an electric revolution. By 2025, we are expected to see 12 million electric cars sold worldwide, but more than 40 million electric bicycles will be sold the same year. Entrepreneurs, city planners and cyclists are more inclined than ever to see electric bicycles are the future of transportation. Their capabilities mean that they are increasingly a viable form of transportation, and a real possibility for replacing, or greatly reducing our car usage.</p>
