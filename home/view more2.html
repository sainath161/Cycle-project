					<p style = "text-indent:2cm;"><b>Electric bicycle </b>offer an environmentally friendly, affordable, efficient, and fun way to get around. When it comes to choosing an electric cycle, you have a number of designs to consider. These systems determine how you control the power on your electric bicycle. There are different types of electric bicycles. <br>1. Pedal Assist<br>2. Pedal Assist<br>3. Speed Pedelec<br><br><b><i>1. Pedal Assist (Pedelec)</i></b><br><p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Pedal-assist, also called Pedelec, only provides propulsion when you pedal. When you stop pedaling, the power shuts off. With this system, you pedal normally and the motor transmits power to the rear wheel to make the pedaling easier. Pedal-assist allows you to ride in high gears and up steep hills almost effortlessly. Pedal-assist offers a number of benefits over throttle-controlled electric cycles. First, pedal-assist gets better range because your pedaling helps to power the bicycle along with the battery. Your battery will drain more slowly because it isn’t providing all of the power by itself. <i>Pedal-assist</i> also gives you more exercise because you have to pedal.<br>
                    </p><br><b><i>2. Throttle</i></b><br><p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Throttle controlled electric cycles work just like a motorcycle or scooter. When you engage the throttle, the motor propels the cycle forward. You don’t have to pedal at all if you don’t want to. The throttle allows you to control the amount of power that the motor sends to the rear wheel. Many electric cycles have a throttle feature in addition to pedal assist. Three styles of electric bicycle throttles include:<br><b>A. Twist throttle-</b> These work the same as a motorcycle or scooter throttle. You just twist a part of the grip toward you to increase power and twist it back to decrease power.<br><b>B. Thumb throttle-</b> This is a small paddle mounted near the handlebar grip that you push down with your thumb. The further you push it, the more power you get.<br><b>C. Push-button throttle-</b> This is a simple on/off switch. When you push the button, the electric motor gives a constant amount of power. When you let go, the power cuts off. You can’t control the amount of power with this type of throttle.</p><br><p style = "text-indent:2cm;">There is a drawback to throttle-controlled electric bicycle. It doesn’t feel as natural to most riders because you don’t have to pedal. The controls are more like a motorcycle than a bicycle. One of your hands is occupied by operating the throttle. There is a bit of a learning curve.</p><br><b><i>3. Speed Pedelec</i></b><br><p style = "text-indent:2cm;">This electric cycle works just like <i>pedal assist</i> electric cycles. The only difference is the top speed. Speed Pedelec electric cycles can reach a maximum speed of 45 kph or 28 mph.<br></p>
