					<p style = "text-indent:2cm;"><b>An electric bicycle </b>(e-bike, eBike, etc.) is a motorized bicycle with an integrated electric motor used to assist propulsion. Many kinds of electric bicycles are available worldwide, but they generally fall into two broad categories: <br>1. Cycles that assist the rider's pedal-power (i.e. pedelecs)<br>2. Cycles that add a throttle, integrating moped-style functionality.</p><br><p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Both retain the ability to be pedaled by the rider and are therefore not electric motorcycles. E-bikes use rechargeable batteries and typically are motor-powered up to 25 to 32 km/h (16 to 20 mph). High-powered varieties can often travel more than 45 km/h (28 mph).
                        Electric Cycles are the more inclusive, more versatile version of the regular bicycle. If you’ve never seen or ridden an electric cycle, picture a normal cycle, add a motor, battery, as well as a throttle or pedal-assist mechanism. The result is a cycle that uses battery power to help you to travel further and faster. Electric cycles travel on an average of 2 – 3 mph faster when compared to mechanical bikes, and people tend to travel further on electric cycles. Some electric cycles can carry riders without any pedalling and are controlled through a throttle, while others use pedal-assist to engage the motor. Most people use electric cycle for commuting, for taking their kids to and from school and by older adults or those with physical limitations who find electric cycle easier, but the possibilities and uses go beyond that with delivery companies now switching to electric cycles and road racers trying out electric road cycles. We’re excited about the future of e-bikes and what’s next for a rapidly growing market!<br></p>
