                    <h2>Discription</h2>
					<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">By restricting others' freedom to act, security is resistance to possible damage (or other undesirable coercive change) inflicted by others. Beneficiaries of security might include individuals and social groups, things and institutions, ecosystems, and any other thing or phenomena that is susceptible to unwelcome change.<br> We are using different types of security systems in this project.</p><br>
                    <h2>Theft Alarm</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">The anti-theft alarm system consists of a series of electrical components that are connected to a property. Via sensors and contacts, they detect movement of the vechile, upon which a loud alarm is produced to alert those nearby of the unauthorised entry.</p><br>
                    <h2>GPS</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a U.S.-owned utility that provides users with positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services. The signal contains data that a receiver uses to compute the locations of the satellites and to make other adjustments needed for accurate positioning. The receiver uses the time difference between the time of signal reception and the broadcast time to compute the distance, or range, from the receiver to the satellite. Thus we can track our vechile.</p><br>
                    <h2>Biometric</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">The five most common types of biometric identifiers are: fingerprints, facial, voice, iris, and palm or finger vein patterns. Here, we are using fingerprints for unlocking the vechicle. Fingerprint recognition systems work by examining a finger pressed against a smooth surface. The finger's ridges and valleys are scanned, and a series of distinct points, where ridges and valleys end or meet, are called minutiae. These minutiae are the points the fingerprint recognition system uses for comparison.</p><br>
