                    <h2>Discription</h2>
					<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Repairing deteriorated, damaged, or out-of-date structures is the process of renovation, often known as remodelling. Buildings that are either commercial or residential often undergo renovations. Additionally, the term "renovation" may be used in social situations to describe creating something new or bringing something back to life. For instance, if a community is reinforced and revitalised, it might be refurbished. It can also mean bringing something back to its previous, better state. Depending on the scope of the refurbishment, the procedure can often be divided into a number of stages. The stages are as follows:</p><br>
                    <h2>Project initiation</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">In the early stages of a project, the design, the scope of the work, the budget, and the needs, expectations, and preferences of the customer and team are all communicated.</p><br>
                    <h2>Existing conditions analysis</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">This include measuring, sketching, and assessing the building that needs to be renovated as well as locating any significant problems that might have an impact on the work that has to be done.</p><br>
                    <h2>Construction and demolition</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Beginning the physical work by carrying out the necessary demolition, structural repairs, construction of new intended conditions, application of finishes, and troubleshooting of any issues or unidentified circumstances that emerge during construction.</p><br>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Renovation projects call for not just flexibility but also a multi-party strategy that has been approved. Feedback from the designer and the project's financial backers will be incorporated into the planning process. Planning will also include gathering information necessary for project completion, after which the project plan will be amended and approved before renovations can start.</p><br>
                    <h2>Reasons to Renovate</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">For example, many homeowners make house improvements to give them a fresh look. Home renovations may increase a home's value as a reliable source of income. Homeowners frequently make improvements to their properties to raise the resale value and maximize their profit. Additionally, homeowners can desire to instal additions that improve their home's sustainability, greenery, or energy efficiency. Additionally, a homeowner's personal tastes and demands may alter with time, and the house may undergo renovations for better looks, comfort, or practicality. Other types of renovations also can be initiated for similar reasons.</p><br>
                    <h2>Effects</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Renovation has several impacts, including:</p>
                    <ul>
