                    <h2>Discription</h2>
					<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Your cost estimates forecast the amount of money needed to complete a project. This information is crucial because it helps you decide if it is worth bidding for the project. The numbers make the difference between whether it’s worth pursuing the project or not. Good project costings help you make informed decisions about which projects to progress and which won’t have a sufficient return on investment. Accurate project costings help you prioritize profitable projects. They are also essential for securing funding for projects, and they provide the baseline for project managers to track financial performance.<br>But how do you get accurate project costs? Here’s our quick guide to the 5 steps for accurate project costing.</p><br>
                    <h2>Understand the scope of the work</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">First, you need to understand what it is the project is going to deliver. Start with the client’s brief. Use what you already know to create a work breakdown structure. This is a graphical representation of the work to be done. It’s useful for highlighting the different areas of project scope, the tasks and effort required. Involve the project team and subject matter experts, the client (where you can, at this stage) and any other stakeholders in the discussions. Your aim is to get a complete picture of what’s needed to deliver the project so you know what you need to estimate. You should end up with a graphic or list of the full scope of the project: everything.</p><br>
                    <h2>Estimate the work</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Next, estimate the work. Take each item on the project scope list you put together in Step 1 and work out the financial cost of it. Guesstimates aren’t good enough. You need accurate estimates to put together an accurate project budget.</p><br>
                    <h2>Include all other costs</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">You’ve costed the project work, but what about everything else? Projects are made up of a mix of direct cost and indirect cost. Depending on how your finance team expect you to budget, you may have to include indirect costs in your project financial estimates. Indirect costs are items like heating and lighting, subsidized snacks, building security costs. They are items that cannot be easily attributed to an individual project and your project may need to include a share of these charges.</p><br>
                    <h2>Add contingency</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">However good you feel your estimates are, it’s always sensible to add reasonable contingency. Contingency is an amount of money added to the budget to be used for unforeseen situations, such as emergency change requests or currency and pricing fluctuations due to market forces. The amount of contingency your project needs depends on the complexity and certainty of the work. If you know what you are going to do, and have experience doing very similar things, you can assume your budgeted costs are accurate. If you are about to embark on a unique and uncertain program, with a high degree of risk, you’ll want to budget more contingency. You can always release contingency funds later if they aren’t needed. Agree an amount of contingency to add to the costs you have so far. Make it explicit and transparent, and agree how it will be accessed if it is needed.</p><br>
                    <h2>Review</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Once you’ve got a final set of project costs that are accurate and reliable, you can share these with the management team.</p>
