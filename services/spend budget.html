                    <h2>Discription</h2>
					<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">A project without a budget is equivalent to a vehicle without gas. In order to begin the project and mobilise all available resources, funding is necessary. As a manager in a project-based organzsation, it will probably be entirely your duty to develop the project budget and keep things moving. Although the idea of a budget may initially sound frightening, you'll soon come to the conclusion that all you really need to do is work out a strategy.</p><br>
                    <h2>Why a project budget is important?</h2>
                    <p><b>First, it's an essential part of securing project funding.</b> The numbers will tell associates exactly how much money is needed to button up the project and when the money is needed. <br><br><b>Second, a well-planned budget provides the basis for project cost control.</b> Having an end budget estimate helps you measure the project’s actual cost against the approved budget and see how much costs you’ve burned already. It will give you an understanding of how the project is progressing and if any changes need to be made to the plan. </p><br>
                    <h2>Analogous Estimation</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Analogous estimation can sometimes be a back-and-forth task, but why not do it the smart way by using project management software? In Forecast, you can easily duplicate one of the past projects to create another one with the same tasks. Then in an instant, you can adjust it to make a better, more situational estimate.</p><br>
                    <h2>Parametric estimation</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">In contrast to analogous estimation, parametric approach is more accurate. It takes cost variables or data points from specific parts of specific projects and applies them to the current project, so you make more decisions based on data. </p><br>
                    <h2>Three-point estimation</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">Three-point estimation is one of the most sensible and pragmatic techniques as it takes into account a weighted average based on the best, worst, and most likely case budget scenarios and encourages you to think from multiple perspectives. Thus you can figure out a realistic cost estimation.</p><br>
