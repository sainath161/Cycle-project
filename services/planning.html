                    <h2>Discription</h2>
					<p style = "text-indent:2cm;">The success of a project depends on the planning phase. The project team will have a clear sense of direction and their roles in the project's success if there is a well-thought-out project plan. The actions and tasks that must be carried out in order to fulfil a milestone or create a deliverable are simply listed in a thorough project plan. The team lead/project manager collaborates with the project team to develop the project's technical design, task list, resource plan, communications strategy, budget, and first timeline. They also define the roles and duties of the project team and its stakeholders during this phase. Iterative project planning is a procedure that can continue periodically all the way through the project. It's possible that work that must be done in the next two months won't require the same level of accuracy as work that must be done more than two to three months from now. But up to the project's conclusion, these plans should be examined and updated monthly. The project's size, complexity, and amount of risk will all affect how frequently iterative planning is done.</p><br>
                    <h2>Communications Plan</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">A communication plan makes it easier to communicate effectively and efficiently with the many audiences that have a significant stake in the project. It outlines the project's communication plan.</p><br>
                    <h2>Resource Allocation Plan</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">The project team is scheduled according to the resource availability and the project time in a resource allocation plan. Resource distribution is crucial because it helps the team leadÂ and team members understand how much work has to be done. Knowing how the team is doing and devoting the appropriate amount of time to each member of the team are both beneficial.</p><br>
                    <h2>Service Transition Plan</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">A service transition plan aids in managing a service's lifecycle change of status. Protecting the product environment involves managing any new, modified, or retired services that may be established or adjusted as part of a project. Curating service knowledge supports issues with service delivery and assists all stakeholders in making knowledgeable, trustworthy judgements. Service transformation requires both controlling service risk and collecting service knowledge.</p><br>
                    <h2>Project Kick-Off Meeting</h2>
                    <p style = "text-indent:2cm;">The project's official launch is acknowledged during the project kickoff meeting. In order to ensure that everyone is aware of the approved Project and Plan, the team lead utilises this meeting to convey a shared understanding of the Project. The Project Kickoff Meeting offers the following opportunities:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduce Team Members</li>
                        <li>Review Project Scope, Definition and Objectives</li>
                        <li>Review High-level Timeline & Milestones, Roles, and Budget</li>
                        <li>Review Challenges</li>
                        <li>Explain Next Steps, etc.,</li>
                    </ul>
